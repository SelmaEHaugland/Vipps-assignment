### Prerequisites

I have used Mac OS for this task.

To run the script, the are some things that need to be installed:
  -python3
You can install this by typing
```bash
brew install python3
```
  -pip3
This is installed when you install python3

  -Flask
You can install this by typing
```bash
pip3 install Flask
```


### Functionality

  -finding the number of occurrences of a topic in a wikipedia article.

### Usage

To run the script you can type the following commands:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=main
flask run
```

You will then recieve a url:
```bash
> Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

If you paste the url in a web browser, you will see my frontend.

You can now type in the information that is needed, and the result will be shown after you press the button "Submit"

### Additional information
I solved this task in one script instead of divide the task into two parts (backend and frondend).
